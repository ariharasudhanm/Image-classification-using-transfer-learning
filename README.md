<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Training_samples][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/ariharasudhanm/Image-classification-using-transfer-learning/blob/main/Images/Samples_from_Original_dataset.png) |    [![Training and validation accuracy][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/ariharasudhanm/Image-classification-using-transfer-learning/blob/main/Images/Training_and_Validation_accuracy.png)

Project Overview:
* There are three directories inside the dataset directory called test, val(for validation) and train  where each directories contains 2 directories called    acoustic and electric which contains respective categories of images.
* We need their absolute path of these directories to feed it when creating a train, test, validation datasets.
* In order to avoid confusions running it on different OS platforms we considering the absloute path of the images while creating datasets.
* You can add more images to their respective images directories if needed.

### Built With

These are programming languages, libraries, frameworks, cloud services and other tools used in this project.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
